# Null Is Zero

Null Is Zero is a (WIP) remade version of the game with the same title made for Ludum Dare 45, featuring a level editor and many new mechanics.
It's a puzzle game based on Baba Is You, where you can push around numbers and mathematical symbols to crate equations, and win the level by creating an equation that satisfies a conditional statment.

To run the game, download LÖVE (https://love2d.org/) and then open the game folder with LÖVE.
